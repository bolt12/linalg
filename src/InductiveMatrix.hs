- Representable functors rather than their index types (logarithms).
- Specified via denotational homomorphisms.

-- TODO: rebuild this fwd definition by composing isomorphisms, eliminating the
-- explicit fwd/rev split. This fwd definition is already built from invertible
-- operations (including scale and fmap of an invertible operation). Dan's
-- failable patterns may be relevant. Can we do so without abstraction leak and
-- without building in a decomposition bias?

-- TODO: Generalize from F.L to all linear map representations. I guess we'll
-- need the intersection of Obj constraints. Or is there a single Obj that all
-- linear map representations can share (not just all _current_)? With careful
-- choice of primitives on all linear map representations, we can probably write
-- a single representation-polymorphic isomorphism that works for _all_ pairs of
-- representations (not just all current). On the other hand, we could instead
-- compose an isomorphism to F.L with an isomorphism from F.L to get the
-- representation-polymorphic isomorphism.
